# Firebase Security Rules Silent Write Discard

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with Firebase Security Rules where write operations might appear successful to the client, yet the data is not persistently stored or gets overwritten. This can lead to unexpected data loss or inconsistencies.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.

This issue can occur due to improperly configured security rules, race conditions, or other concurrency-related problems. Understanding and debugging this type of error requires carefully examining the rules and client-side interactions.
